    - Used in search results.
- **Artist (Prisma schema already defined):**
    - Used in search results.
- **SearchQuery:** (Optional, for search history or analytics)
    - queryId (string, PK)
    - userId (FK to User, optional for anonymous searches)
    - queryText (string)
    - timestamp (datetime)
    - filtersApplied (JSON or string to store applied filters)
    - ... other search query metadata

## API Endpoints

- **Search Endpoints:**
    - `GET /search?q={query}`: Global search endpoint - search across all content types.
        - **Method:** GET
        - **Parameters:**
            - `q`: search query string (required)
            - `type`: content type filter (optional: 'track' | 'album' | 'artist' | 'event' | 'merchandise' | 'news')
            - `genre`: genre filter (optional)
            - `artist`: artist filter (optional)
            - ... other filters as needed
        - **Response:** Paginated results, categorized by content type.

- **Search Suggestion Endpoints (Optional):**
    - `GET /search/suggestions?q={query}`: Get search suggestions based on query.
        - **Method:** GET
        - **Response:** List of suggested search terms.

## Code Readability and Coding Standards

- **Component Structure:** Organize components in `components/search` directory.
- **Reusable Components:** Utilize reusable components like `SectionCarousel`, `SectionGrid`, `TrackList`, `AlbumGrid`, `ArtistCard` where applicable.
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive and consistent names for components, props, functions, and variables related to search.
- **Code Comments:** Add comments to explain complex search logic, autocomplete functionality, and result categorization.
- **Performance Optimization:** Write efficient code to handle search queries and render results quickly.
- **Code Formatting:** Use code formatters (e.g., Prettier) for consistent code formatting.

## Documentation Quality

- **Component Documentation:** Document each Search feature component (e.g., `SearchBar`, `SearchResults`, `SearchFilters`) with clear descriptions, prop definitions, and usage guidelines.
- **API Documentation:** Document Search API endpoints (e.g., `/search`, `/search/suggestions`) using Swagger, detailing request/response schemas and parameters.
- **Feature-level Documentation:** Maintain documentation for the Search feature, outlining its sections, components, data sources (search indexes), and API endpoints (like this plan).

## Testability

- **Unit Tests for Components:** Write unit tests for Search components (e.g., `SearchBar`, `SearchResults`, `SearchFilters`, `SearchSuggestionList`) to ensure UI rendering and search interaction logic are correct.
- **Integration Tests for SearchService:** Test `SearchService` functions (handling search queries, interacting with search indexes, aggregating and ranking results) by mocking search index interactions and verifying search logic.
- **End-to-End Tests (Optional):** Consider E2E tests for key user flows on the Search page, such as performing a global search, using search filters, and navigating search results.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Scalable Search Indexes:** Utilize scalable search index technologies (e.g., Elasticsearch, Algolia) to handle a large volume of searchable data and user queries efficiently.
- **Optimize Search Queries:** Optimize search queries to search indexes to ensure fast search response times, considering indexing strategies and query optimization techniques specific to the chosen search index technology.
- **Caching Search Results:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to cache frequently accessed search results and search suggestions to reduce load on search indexes and improve response times.
- **Load Balancing Search Service:** Consider load balancing `SearchService` instances to handle a high volume of concurrent search requests.

## Security Considerations

- ** защита от DoS Attacks:** Implement rate limiting and throttling on search API endpoints to protect against abuse and DoS attacks from excessive search requests.
- **Secure Query Handling:** Sanitize and validate user search queries to prevent potential injection attacks or malicious queries that could impact search index performance.
- **Access Control for Searchable Data:** Ensure proper access control is in place for the data being indexed and searched, so search results only include publicly accessible content or content the user is authorized to access.
- **API Authentication (for Search History/Recommendations):** If implementing search history or personalized recommendations, secure related API endpoints with JWT authentication to protect user-specific data.
