## Code Readability and Coding Standards

- **Component Structure:** Organize components within `components/settings-profile` directory.
- **Reusable Components:** Reuse common components like input fields, buttons, and forms from the `components/ui` and `components/shared` directories.
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive and consistent names for components, props, functions, and variables.
- **Code Comments:** Add comments to explain complex UI logic and settings management functionalities.
- **Code Formatting:** Maintain consistent code formatting using Prettier.

## Documentation Quality

- **Component Documentation:** Document each Settings & Profile component, detailing its purpose, props, and usage within the settings page.
- **API Documentation:** Document all Settings & Profile API endpoints (under `/settings` and `/fan`/`/artist` prefixes) using Swagger, including request/response schemas and authentication requirements.
- **Feature-level Documentation:** Maintain documentation for the Settings & Profile feature, outlining its sections, components, data models, and API endpoints (like this plan).

## Testability

- **Unit Tests for Components:** Write unit tests for Settings & Profile components (e.g., `ProfileSettingsUI`, `AccountSettingsUI`, `NotificationSettingsUI`, `WalletSettingsUI`) to ensure UI rendering and settings interaction logic are correct.
- **Integration Tests for Services:** Test `ProfileService`, `SettingsService`, and `Web3IntegrationService` functions related to settings and profile management, mocking backend API calls and external services (e.g., Web3 wallet).
- **End-to-End Tests (Optional):** Consider E2E tests for key settings and profile workflows, such as updating profile information, changing passwords, managing notifications, and connecting/disconnecting wallets.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries for fetching and updating user settings and profile information to ensure efficient performance for a large user base.
- **Caching User Settings:** Consider caching frequently accessed user settings data to reduce database load.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations for non-critical settings updates or data fetching to maintain UI responsiveness.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement JWT authentication to secure all Settings & Profile API endpoints, ensuring only logged-in users can access and modify their own settings and profile.
- **Secure Password Handling:** Use strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) when changing passwords. Follow secure password reset procedures.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure sensitive user data (profile information, email, settings) is protected and only accessible to the authorized user and admin users with appropriate permissions.
- **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication to protect sensitive data transmitted during settings and profile updates.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs in settings forms to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
