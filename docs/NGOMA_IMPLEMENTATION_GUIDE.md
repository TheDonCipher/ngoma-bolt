# Ngoma Website Implementation Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step plan for developers to implement the Ngoma website, a music platform with various features including music streaming, NFT integration, admin and artist dashboards, and more. This guide is based on the provided architecture diagrams and feature plans.

## Guide Structure

For better organization, the implementation guide has been split into several focused documents:

1. [Project Setup Guide](docs/setup_guide.md) - Initial configuration, environment setup, and database configuration
2. [Backend Implementation Guide](docs/backend_guide.md) - Authentication, API endpoints, and server-side logic
3. [Frontend Implementation Guide](docs/frontend_guide.md) - UI components, layouts, and client-side features
4. [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment_guide.md) - Testing and deploying the application
5. [Security Guide](docs/security_guide.md) - Best practices for securing the application

Each guide provides detailed instructions specific to that aspect of the implementation. Please follow them in the suggested order for the most efficient development process.

## Project Architecture

Ngoma follows a modern web application architecture with clearly separated frontend and backend components:

### Backend Architecture

- **NestJS Framework**: Provides a structured, module-based approach with dependency injection
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access with automatic migrations
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for storing user data, music content, and platform information
- **REST API**: Main interface between frontend and backend systems
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure, token-based authentication system

### Frontend Architecture

- **Next.js Framework**: React-based framework with server-side rendering capabilities
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular UI components for reusability and maintainability
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for global state management
- **Web3 Integration**: Wallet connection and blockchain interaction components

### Key Diagrams

- [Authentication Flow Diagram](diagrams/auth-flow-diagram.md) - Detailed sequence diagram of the authentication process
- [Admin Dashboard Diagram](diagrams/admin-dashboard-diagram.md) - Visual representation of the admin dashboard architecture

## Project Overview

Ngoma is a music platform that combines traditional music streaming with Web3 features including NFT integration. The platform serves three main user types:

- **Administrators**: Manage platform content, users, and settings
- **Artists**: Upload music, create NFTs, manage profile and analytics
- **Fans/Listeners**: Stream music, collect NFTs, interact with artists

The application is built with:

- Next.js frontend
- NestJS backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Prisma ORM
- Web3 integration for blockchain features

## Implementation Strategy

The recommended implementation strategy follows these phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**:

   - Project setup and configuration
   - Database schema design and implementation
   - Core authentication system

2. **Backend Core Phase**:

   - API development
   - Business logic implementation
   - Integration with database

3. **Frontend Core Phase**:

   - UI components development
   - Page layouts and routing
   - API integration

4. **Web3 Integration Phase**:

   - Smart contract integration
   - Wallet connection
   - NFT functionality

5. **Testing & Deployment Phase**:
   - Testing across environments
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Production deployment

Refer to the specific guides for detailed implementation instructions for each phase.
