# Ngoma Security Guide

This document outlines security best practices and implementation guidelines for the Ngoma platform.

## Authentication and Authorization Security

1. **JWT Security Best Practices:**

   - Store JWT secrets securely using environment variables (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`)
   - Implement token expiration (short-lived tokens)
   - Consider implementing refresh token rotation
   - Use secure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags when storing tokens
   - Implement proper CSRF protection

2. **Password Security:**

   - Use `bcrypt` for password hashing when storing user passwords
   - Enforce strong password policies
   - Implement account lockouts after multiple failed login attempts
   - Support two-factor authentication for sensitive operations

3. **Protected Routes:**
   - Use `AuthGuard` to protect all API endpoints requiring authentication
   - Use `RolesGuard` to protect admin-only endpoints
   - Implement proper access control checks at the API level

## Input Validation and Data Sanitization

1. **Input Validation:**

   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
   - Use validation pipes in NestJS to validate request bodies
   - Implement proper data type checks and constraints

2. **Protection Against Common Attacks:**
   - Implement protection against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
   - Protect against SQL injection using parameterized queries/ORM
   - Implement CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
   - Set secure HTTP headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

## API Security

1. **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**

   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints, especially authentication endpoints
   - Use NestJS ThrottlerModule or similar libraries
   - Configure appropriate rate limits based on endpoint sensitivity

2. **CORS Configuration:**

   - Configure CORS properly to allow only legitimate origins
   - Restrict HTTP methods and headers appropriately
   - Use the principle of least privilege when configuring CORS

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
   - Use generic error messages for production environments
   - Log detailed errors server-side for debugging

## Web3 Security Considerations

1. **Wallet Integration Security:**

   - Implement secure wallet connection using reputable Web3 libraries
   - Never store private keys on the frontend or server
   - Validate all blockchain transactions server-side when possible

2. **Smart Contract Security:**

   - Ensure smart contracts are audited for security vulnerabilities
   - Implement proper access control in smart contracts
   - Follow smart contract security best practices

3. **NFT Security:**
   - Verify NFT ownership securely before granting access to premium content
   - Implement proper error handling for blockchain interactions
   - Consider gas price fluctuations and transaction failures

## Infrastructure Security

1. **HTTPS:**

   - Enforce HTTPS for all communications
   - Configure proper SSL/TLS settings
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

2. **Dependency Management:**

   - Keep all dependencies up-to-date
   - Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Remove unused dependencies

3. **Environment Security:**
   - Securely manage environment variables
   - Use secrets management tools for production environments
   - Implement proper access controls for production infrastructure

## Security Monitoring and Response

1. **Logging and Monitoring:**

   - Implement comprehensive logging for security events
   - Set up monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Configure alerts for potential security breaches

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Develop an incident response plan
   - Implement procedures for addressing security vulnerabilities
   - Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing

By following these security guidelines, you can build a robust and secure Ngoma platform that protects user data and maintains platform integrity.
