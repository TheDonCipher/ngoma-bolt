    - `GET /albums/{albumId}`: Get album details by ID.

- **Album Playback Endpoints:**
    - `GET /albums/{albumId}/tracks`: Get tracks for an album (for album detail page).
    - `GET /tracks/{trackId}/preview`: Get track preview URL (for non-NFT holders).
    - `GET /tracks/{trackId}/full`: Get full track URL (for NFT holders - auth required).

- **Artist Album Management Endpoints (Artist Dashboard - under `/artist` prefix):**
    - `POST /artist/albums`: Create a new album.
    - `GET /artist/albums`: Get list of artist's albums.
    - `GET /artist/albums/{albumId}`: Get artist's album details.
    - `PUT /artist/albums/{albumId}`: Update album details.
    - `DELETE /artist/albums/{albumId}`: Delete album.

    - `GET /search?q={query}&type=album`: Search for albums by keyword.

## Code Readability and Coding Standards

- **Code Style Guide:** Follow the project's code style guide (e.g., Airbnb, Google) for consistency.
- **Component Structure:** Organize components logically in directories (e.g., `components/albums`).
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for components, props, functions, and variables.
- **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic and component usage.
- **Keep components focused:** Each component should have a single responsibility.

## Documentation Quality

- **Component Documentation:** Document each component's purpose, props, and usage in comments or separate documentation files.
- **API Documentation:** Document API endpoints using Swagger or similar tools, detailing request/response schemas, parameters, and error codes.
- **Feature-level Documentation:** Maintain documentation for the Albums feature, outlining its functionality, components, and data flow (like this plan).

## Testability

- **Unit Tests for Components:** Write unit tests for AlbumGrid, AlbumCard, AlbumDetailTracks, AlbumForm, etc., to ensure UI components render correctly and handle interactions as expected.
- **Integration Tests for AlbumService:** Test AlbumService functions (fetching albums, album details, tracks) by mocking API calls and verifying data handling.
- **End-to-End Tests (Optional):** Implement E2E tests for key user flows like browsing albums, viewing album details, and artist album management.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Caching Album Data:** Implement caching in AlbumService to store frequently accessed album data (grids, lists, details) to reduce database load.
- **Pagination for Album Lists:** Use pagination for album browsing endpoints (`/albums`, `/albums/genres`, `/albums/recent`) to handle large catalogs efficiently.
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Implement lazy loading for album art images in AlbumCard and AlbumHeader to improve initial page load performance.
- **Database Indexing:** Ensure proper database indexing on album-related tables for efficient querying and sorting.

## Security Considerations

- **NFT Ownership Verification:** Securely verify NFT ownership on the backend before allowing full album playback.
- **API Authentication:** Protect artist album management endpoints (`/artist/albums`) with JWT authentication to ensure only artists can manage their albums.
- **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs in AlbumForm and AlbumManagementService to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- **Access Control:** Implement proper access control to ensure only authorized users (admins, artists) can perform album management actions.
