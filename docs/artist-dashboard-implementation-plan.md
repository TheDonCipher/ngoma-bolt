# Artist Dashboard Implementation Plan

## 1. Information Gathering and Clarification:

*   Gathered the content of `components/dashboard/artist/ArtistDashboard.tsx`, `app/dashboard/artist/layout.tsx`, and `app/dashboard/artist/page.tsx`, as well as the folder structure of `app/dashboard/artist/`.
*   Clarified that the "public-facing Artist Page" is located at `@/components/dashboard/artist/ArtistProfileEditForm.tsx` and `@/components/dashboard/artist/ArtistPublicProfilePreview.tsx`. When a user clicks on an artist, they should be directed to this page: "the public-facing Artist Page". Create a new file if you have to. This is the artist profile. Should be different from the dashboard.

## 2. High-Level Plan:

Based on the user's feedback and clarification, here's the high-level plan:

1.  **Artist Page Editing & Preview:**
    *   Implement `ArtistProfileEditForm.tsx` to allow artists to modify their profile details.
    *   Implement `ArtistPublicProfilePreview.tsx` to provide a real-time preview of the changes.
    *   Create a new route (e.g., `/artist/[artistId]`) for the public-facing Artist Page.
    *   Connect the edit form and preview to the new Artist Page route.
2.  **Merchandise Management:**
    *   Refine the existing merchandise creation page (`app/dashboard/artist/merchandise/create/page.tsx`).
    *   Implement a merchandise management system with image uploads, descriptions, pricing, inventory tracking, and variations.
    *   Integrate the merchandise management system into the Artist Dashboard.
3.  **Event Scheduling:**
    *   Refine the existing event creation page (`app/dashboard/artist/events/create/page.tsx`).
    *   Implement features for recurring events and integration with calendar applications.
    *   Integrate the event scheduling system into the Artist Dashboard.
4.  **Album Release Scheduling:**
    *   Design and implement a scheduling system for album releases.
    *   Allow artists to set release dates and pre-order options.
    *   Integrate the album release scheduling system into the Artist Dashboard.
5.  **Music Upload & Control:**
    *   Refine the existing music upload page (`app/dashboard/artist/music/upload/page.tsx`).
    *   Provide full control over album and track uploads, including metadata management.
    *   Implement options for free distribution or NFT sales, with clear explanations and guidance.
    *   Ensure secure and efficient file handling.
6.  **Analytics & Insights:**
    *   Implement analytics dashboards providing artists with actionable insights into their music performance.
    *   Present data in a clear, visually appealing, and easily understandable format.
    *   Integrate the analytics dashboards into the Artist Dashboard.

## 3. Detailed Plan with Mermaid Diagrams:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Artist Dashboard
    A[Overview] --> B(Stats, Recent Tracks, Add Track)
    C[Analytics] --> D(Performance Metrics)
    E[Catalog] --> F(Music Management)
    G[Events] --> H(Event Scheduling)
    I[Merchandise] --> J(Merchandise Management)
    K[Profile] --> L(Artist Profile Editing)
    end

    subgraph Artist Profile Editing
    L --> M(ArtistProfileEditForm.tsx)
    M --> N(ArtistPublicProfilePreview.tsx)
    N --> O(/artist/[artistId])
    end

    subgraph Music Management
    F --> P(Music Upload)
    F --> Q(Album Release Scheduling)
    end

    subgraph Event Scheduling
    H --> R(Recurring Events)
    H --> S(Calendar Integration)
    end

    subgraph Merchandise Management
    J --> T(Image Uploads)
    J --> U(Inventory Tracking)
    J --> V(Variation Options)
    end

    subgraph Analytics
    D --> W(Streams, Downloads)
    D --> X(Listener Demographics)
    D --> Y(Geographic Data)
    end
```
