## Logic

## Code Readability and Coding Standards

- **Code Style Guide:** Follow NestJS and general backend code style conventions for consistency.
- **Module Organization:** Organize code into well-defined modules (EventsModule, TicketNFTModule, etc.).
- **Service Layer Abstraction:** Implement clear service interfaces for event and ticket management.
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive and consistent names for classes, methods, and variables.
- **Code Comments:** Add comments to explain complex event management and ticket logic.

## Documentation Quality

- **API Documentation:** Use Swagger to document EventController, ArtistEventController, AdminEventController, and TicketNFTController endpoints. Include request/response schemas, authentication, and error codes.
- **Module and Service Documentation:** Document each module and service with README files explaining their purpose, functionality, and dependencies.
- **Code Comments:** Use JSDoc or similar to document service methods and controller actions.
- **Data Model Documentation:** Document database schema and data models for events, venues, and ticket NFTs (if applicable).

## Testability

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for services, utility functions, and components to ensure business logic correctness and isolate issues.
- **Integration Tests:** Implement integration tests to verify API endpoints and interactions between different modules or services.
- **End-to-End Tests (Optional):** Consider end-to-end tests for critical user flows to ensure the entire system works correctly.
- **Test Coverage:** Aim for reasonable test coverage to catch regressions and ensure code quality.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** Use mocking and stubbing to isolate dependencies and test components in isolation.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Stateless Services:** Design services to be stateless to allow horizontal scaling.
- **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data (like platform metrics).
- **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of services for high availability and performance.
- **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries, indexing, and connection pooling for efficient data access.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations and message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for long-running tasks and background processing.
- **CDN for Static Assets:** Use CDNs to serve static assets (images, CSS, JS) to reduce latency and improve page load times.

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization (RBAC/ABAC) mechanisms to secure API endpoints and protect sensitive data.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs on both the client and server sides to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
- ** защита от CSRF:** Implement CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
- ** защита от XSS:** Protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by sanitizing user inputs and using appropriate templating engines.
- ** защита от SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies up-to-date and monitor for security vulnerabilities.
- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect against brute-force attacks and DoS attacks.
- **Secure Storage of Sensitive Data:**  Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) securely using encryption and environment variables (and ideally a secrets management system).
