# Backend Directory - Backend Application (NestJS)

This directory contains the backend application, built using NestJS.

**Purpose:**

*   **API Endpoints:** Defines and implements RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
*   **Data Handling:** Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, often interacting with databases.
*   **Server-Side Logic:** Implements core application logic, business rules, and workflows.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Handles user authentication and authorization to secure API endpoints.
*   **Integration:** May integrate with third-party services, databases, and other external systems.

**Contents:**

*   `src/`: Contains the source code of the NestJS application.
    *   `app.module.ts`: The root module of the application.
    *   `main.ts`: The entry point of the application.
    *   `[modules]`: Subdirectories for different modules (e.g., `auth`, `users`, `albums`).
    *   `[services]`: Services containing business logic.
    *   `[controllers]`: Controllers handling API requests and responses.
    *   `[entities]`: Data entities and models.
*   `prisma/`: Contains Prisma database schema and migrations.
*   `test/`: Integration and unit tests for the backend application.
*   `package.json`, `package-lock.json`: Node.js package management files.
*   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.

**Implementation Guide:**

Developers working in this directory are responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. This includes designing and implementing API endpoints, managing data, and ensuring the backend is secure, scalable, and performant. Follow NestJS best practices and architectural patterns.

When implementing backend features, consider:

*   **API Design:** Design clear, consistent, and well-documented APIs.
*   **Data Modeling:** Create efficient and well-structured database schemas.
*   **Business Logic:** Implement robust and reliable business logic.
*   **Security:** Implement security best practices, including authentication and authorization.
*   **Performance:** Optimize backend performance and scalability.
*   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   **Documentation:** Document APIs and backend logic for maintainability.
