## Code Readability and Coding Standards

- **Component Structure:** Organize components in `components/explore` directory.
- **Reusable Components:** Utilize reusable components like `SectionCarousel`, `SectionGrid`, `TrackList`, `AlbumGrid`, `ArtistCard` to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for components, props, functions, and variables within the Explore feature.
- **Code Comments:** Add comments to explain complex UI logic, data fetching, and explore page section functionalities.
- **Code Formatting:** Maintain consistent code formatting using Prettier.

## Documentation Quality

- **Component Documentation:** Document each Explore page component (e.g., `TrendingSongsSection`, `GenreShowcaseSection`) with clear descriptions of their purpose, props, and usage.
- **API Documentation:** Document Explore page API endpoints (e.g., `/explore/trending-songs`, `/explore/genres`) using Swagger, detailing request/response schemas and parameters.
- **Feature-level Documentation:** Maintain documentation for the Explore feature, outlining its sections, components, data sources, and API endpoints (like this plan).

## Testability

- **Unit Tests for Components:** Write unit tests for Explore page components (e.g., `TrendingSongsSection`, `GenreShowcaseSection`, `SectionCarousel`, `SectionGrid`) to ensure UI rendering and section-specific logic are correct.
- **Integration Tests for ExploreService:** Test `ExploreService` functions (fetching trending songs, featured artists, genre-based albums, etc.) by mocking API calls and verifying data aggregation and filtering logic.
- **End-to-End Tests (Optional):** Consider E2E tests for key user flows on the Explore page, such as browsing trending songs, navigating genre sections, and using search filters.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Caching Explore Data:** Implement caching in `ExploreService` to cache data for explore sections (trending songs, featured artists, etc.) to minimize backend load and improve page load times.
- **Pagination for Lists:** Ensure pagination is implemented for any lists of content displayed on the Explore page (e.g., trending songs, genre-based albums) to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Lazy Loading Images:** Implement lazy loading for album art and artist images in Explore sections to improve initial page load performance.
- **Efficient Data Aggregation:** Optimize data aggregation logic in `ExploreService` to efficiently fetch and combine data from different backend services and databases.
- **CDN for Static Assets:** Utilize a CDN to serve static assets (images, CSS, JS) for the Explore page to reduce latency and improve performance.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Exposure:** Ensure that Explore page API endpoints only expose public content and do not inadvertently expose any sensitive or private data.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on Explore page API endpoints to protect against excessive requests and potential abuse.
- ** защита от XSS:** Protect against XSS vulnerabilities in Explore page components, especially when displaying user-generated content or dynamic data.
- **API Authentication (for Recommendations):** If implementing personalized recommendations, secure the recommendations endpoint (`/explore/recommendations`) with JWT authentication to ensure only authenticated users can access their recommendations.
